			<p>Below is a selection of my sonic explorations from around 2000 up to about 2006, presented here in reverse chronological order. Music is something I haven’t done for a while but I decided to brush these off and make them available here as I have recently started to get interested in producing more: you have been warned!</p>

			<p>Despite my love of noise—sometimes at its most extreme—most of these seem pretty restrained to me now that I lsten to them again. For the most part they were made with <Anchor href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" link="SuperCollider"/>, an audio programming language, which I have used sometimes to make generative music and sometimes as a means to generate individual sounds that would be sequenced afterwards in a more traditional manner. As time goes on these pieces get less about actual instruments and more about generated sound or processed found sound. Also the origins of these and the means of their production have become blurred or forgotten allowing me to hear them as if they were the work of someone else.</p>

			<p>I enjoy listening to these from time to time and I think it’s possible to trace a line of development through them. One of the main themes of these pieces would be the tension between improvised playing—for me this is primarily clarinet and occasionally guitar—and computer-generated sound. These seem to represent opposite poles of sound-making and stand apart like a painting by Mark Rothko and a drawing by Sol LeWitt, coming respectively from a more visceral or cerebral source. Another major theme is that of randomness—influenced doubtless by the ideas of John Cage, or maybe just a manifestation of my lack of decision-making abilities.</p>

			<p>Finally a word on the titles. I struggle with these and for some reason like to give pieces titles which are in some way evocative but have no meaning in any known language. They usually come from working titles and have some linguistic link to their origin at some deep and unfathomable level.</p>

			<p>Anyway here they are. Enjoy.</p>
